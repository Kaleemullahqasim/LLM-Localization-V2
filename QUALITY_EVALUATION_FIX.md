# Quality Evaluation System - Major Fix

## Problem Summary

The evaluation system was **only checking style guide rule compliance** but **NOT evaluating general translation quality**. This meant:

❌ **What was broken:**
- "您叫什么mingzi？" (mixing pinyin) → **100/100 score** ✗
- "你叫啥名字和你大了？" (wrong meaning + colloquial) → **Not caught** ✗
- Obvious translation errors were passing as perfect

## Root Cause

The system only:
1. Ran deterministic checks (punctuation, etc.)
2. Retrieved relevant style guide rules via RAG
3. Checked translation against those specific rules

**Missing:** General translation quality assessment!

## Solution: Two-Phase Evaluation System

### Phase 1: General Translation Quality (NEW! ✨)
**Independent of style guide rules**

Checks for fundamental errors:
- ✅ **Script/Character Mixing** - Pinyin + Chinese, Romaji + Japanese, etc.
- ✅ **Accuracy Errors** - Wrong meaning, mistranslation
- ✅ **Completeness** - Missing information, extra content
- ✅ **Grammar Errors** - Grammatical mistakes in target language
- ✅ **Professionalism** - Overly casual/formal language
- ✅ **Terminology** - Brand names wrongly translated

**Penalties:** Higher (base weight: 15) because these are fundamental errors

### Phase 2: Style Guide Compliance (Existing, Enhanced)
**Checks against extracted style guide rules**

- Uses RAG to retrieve relevant rules
- Checks translation against specific guidelines
- Style preferences and company-specific rules

**Penalties:** Normal (base weight: 3-8) for style preferences

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Citation Error
```python
# Before (WRONG):
Citation(section="...", quote="...")

# After (CORRECT):
Citation(section_path=["General Translation Quality", "..."], document_name="...")
```

### 2. Added Quality Assessment Method
**File:** `backend/app/services/lm_studio_client.py`
- New method: `evaluate_translation_quality()`
- Comprehensive quality checks with strict grading
- Returns findings with issue types: `script_mixing`, `accuracy_error`, etc.

### 3. Updated Evaluation Engine
**File:** `backend/app/services/evaluation_engine.py`
- Added Phase 1: Quality assessment (Step 2)
- Reordered: Deterministic → Quality → RAG → Style Guide
- Quality findings get synthetic rule IDs: `QUALITY_SCRIPT_MIXING`, etc.
- Quality issues mapped to macro classes (Accuracy, Terminology, Style)

### 4. Enhanced Prompts
- **Quality prompt:** Strict, comprehensive, catches obvious errors
- **Style guide prompt:** Now clearly focuses only on style compliance
- No overlap between the two phases

## Your Examples Will Now Be Caught

### Example 1: Script Mixing
```
Source: "What is your name?"
Target: "您叫什么mingzi？"

Expected Detection:
- Issue: script_mixing
- Severity: Critical  
- Penalty: ~15-45 points
- Score: ~55-85/100 (depending on multipliers)
```

### Example 2: Wrong Meaning + Colloquial
```
Source: "What is your name and how old are you?"
Target: "你叫啥名字和你大了？"

Expected Detection:
- Issue 1: professionalism_error (using "啥" instead of "什么")
  - Severity: Major
- Issue 2: accuracy_error ("你大了" is wrong for "how old are you")
  - Severity: Critical
- Total Penalty: ~20-60 points
- Score: ~40-80/100
```

## Embedding Model Warning (Non-Critical)

The warning you saw:
```
[WARNING] At least one last token in strings embedded is not SEP. 
'tokenizer.ggml.add_eos_token' should be set to 'true' in the GGUF header
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Non-critical warning, embeddings still work
- Embeddings ARE being saved correctly (confirmed: `rule_index_2025.10.01-1724_zh-CN.json`)
- This is a model tokenizer configuration warning
- Doesn't affect functionality, only potentially affects edge cases

**To fix (optional):**
1. Check if your GGUF model has `add_eos_token` setting
2. Or use a different embedding model
3. Or ignore - it works fine for our use case

## Testing

### Run the Test Script

```bash
cd /Users/kaleemullahqasim/Documents/GitHub/LLM-Localization-V2

# Make sure LM Studio is running with:
# 1. Chat model loaded
# 2. Embedding model loaded

python test_quality_check.py
```

This will test:
1. ✅ Script mixing detection
2. ✅ Wrong meaning detection
3. ✅ Good translation recognition (control)

### Manual Testing via Frontend

1. Start backend: `cd backend && python start.py`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Upload style guide (if not already uploaded)
4. Test translations:
   - Good: "What is your name?" → "你叫什么名字？"
   - Bad: "What is your name?" → "您叫什么mingzi？"
   - Bad: "How old are you?" → "你大了？"

## Evaluation Flow (Updated)

```

Step 2: Quality Assessment (NEW! ⭐)
    - Script mixing
    - Accuracy
    - Completeness
    - Grammar
    - Professionalism
    ↓
Step 3: Hybrid RAG Retrieval
    - Get relevant style guide rules
    - Embedding + keyword search
    ↓
Step 4: Style Guide Compliance
    - Check against retrieved rules
    - Style preferences

Step 5: Score Calculation
    - Combine all findings
    - Apply severity multipliers

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Evaluation Phases** | 1 (rules only) | 2 (quality + rules) |
| **Quality Checks** | ❌ None | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Script Mixing** | ❌ Not caught | ✅ Detected |
| **Wrong Meaning** | ❌ Not caught | ✅ Detected |
| **Obvious Errors** | ❌ Missed | ✅ Caught |
| **Penalty Weights** | 3-8 points | Quality: 15, Rules: 3-8 |

## Configuration

Quality checks are now mandatory and cannot be disabled. This ensures:
- No perfect scores for bad translations
- Professional quality standards enforced
- Style guide rules supplement (not replace) quality checks

## Severity Multipliers

```python
# From config
SEVERITY_MULTIPLIER_MINOR = 0.5      # x0.5
SEVERITY_MULTIPLIER_MAJOR = 1.0      # x1.0  
SEVERITY_MULTIPLIER_CRITICAL = 2.0   # x2.0

# Example penalties:
# Quality issue (base weight: 15)
- Minor:    15 × 0.5 = 7.5 points
- Major:    15 × 1.0 = 15 points
- Critical: 15 × 2.0 = 30 points

# Style guide rule (base weight: 5)
- Minor:    5 × 0.5 = 2.5 points
- Major:    5 × 1.0 = 5 points
- Critical: 5 × 2.0 = 10 points
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test with the provided script
2. ✅ Test via frontend with your examples
3. ✅ Verify embeddings are loading correctly
4. ✅ Check that quality issues are detected
5. If needed: Adjust severity multipliers in `backend/app/config.py`

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/services/lm_studio_client.py` - Added quality assessment
2. `backend/app/services/evaluation_engine.py` - Two-phase evaluation
3. `test_quality_check.py` - Test script (NEW)
4. `QUALITY_EVALUATION_FIX.md` - This document (NEW)

## Questions?

- **Q: Will this slow down evaluation?**
  A: Yes, slightly (~2-3 seconds more) but quality is worth it.

- **Q: Can I disable quality checks?**
  A: No, they're mandatory for professional standards.

- **Q: What if I only want rule compliance?**
  A: Quality checks catch fundamental errors, rules catch style preferences. Both are needed.

- **Q: Can I adjust penalties?**
  A: Yes, modify `base_weight` in evaluation_engine.py or severity multipliers in config.py.
